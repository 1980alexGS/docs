# VzBoT 330 - Printed Version

VzBot 330 is the original VzBoT printer and has been in development since 2020. It is a high
speed, moderately sized 3D-printer, based on the TronXY XS5(A) CoreXY frame, but can be
easily adapted for other 2020 aluminium extrusion frames. The design is built around the
popular TronXY XS5(A) but is not restricted to this size, the frame can be scaled
according to the individual needs of the builder.
