 7. Once the user receives his package he can press the finish button and give you a review.

 If at anytime during the Printing fase you can not finish the order so after you've made a Deal and agreed to the price and timeframe you can press the Revoke button. This will be noted in your provider profile and will be visible by customers when you accept their order.
