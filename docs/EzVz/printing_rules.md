# Print Rules

When applying you need to print a VzCube and show us the pictures of all 6 sides.
You can see the allowed filaments and the required print settings [here](https://docs.vzbot.org/ezvz/filaments).

## Forbidden Filaments

Filaments which include glitter or cf filaments are not allowed for the application because they can hide printing artifacts.

## Pictures

The pictures must show:

1. All six sides of the printed cube
2. The light should be neutral and coming from the front.
3. Use calipers on all 3 axis (x, y, z) to show us dimensional accuracy.
