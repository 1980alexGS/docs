# Print settings

It is recommended to print all parts in ABS (not ABS+), ASA or similar material to be able to withstand
the high temperature environment of an enclosed printer.

Print settings should always be tuned for the material of choice and tested for sufficient strength,
proper layer adhesion and mechenical load.

## For stationary parts

Parts such as motor mounts, bed frame braces, etc.
