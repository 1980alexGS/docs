**Gantry comes pre-assembled with printed parts in PLA that are for transportation only. It should not be used on the printer. You can easily replace the parts without disassembling the whole thing. All LDO rails are from factory, and should also be cleaned and lubricated. It is also adviced to verify MGN12 Y rails for proper aligment using the alignment [tool](https://github.com/VzBoT3D/VzBoT-Vz330/blob/master/Assemblies%20BOM%20and%20STL/Alignment%20Tools/MGN12-alignment%20tool.stl). **
