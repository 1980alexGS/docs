# 1. Frame

## Overview

![Frame](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/overview.png)

The frame is assembled through a combination of blind joints and corner brackets. The corner brackets are to help stiffen up the frame and are optional, though we highly recommend using them on every possible corner for best results.

For detailed informations on how to assemble blind joints visit this [page](../general/blind-joints)

### Step 1

To start you are going to build the bottom and the z profiles of the frame first, this is necessary because the gantry comes pre assembled form
mellow. Take two **Aluminium 1** profiles and two **Aluminium 2** profiles, also take the four 2040 **Aluminium 3** profiles. <br>

### Step 2
Combine the **Aluminium 3** profiles with **Aluminium 1** and **Aluminium 2** profiles with M5 25mm screws. Line shown on the picture below.

### Step 3

Next flip your now assembled frame up side down so the "closed" part is on top and put in the M4 boat nut. Use the following assembly technique:
First, align the M4 nut with the aluminium profile groove and put it into the aluminium profile groove. Unscrew with the screwdriver and release the M4 boat nut. A pictured description is below

### Step 4

The last step for the actual frame assembly is adding two more **Aluminium 1** profiles to the top of the frame. Use the outer part of the 2040 profiles and loosly screw the profiles down with M5 25mm screws. Loosly is enough due to the reason that we can bolt them down when the preassembled gantry slot's in place.

Congrats you have successfully built the frame to you VzBoT. This is the start of something truly impressive. This is like the foundation to your printer and is really important that it is built correctly.
