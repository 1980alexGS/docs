# 2. Frame

## Overview

![Frame](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/overview.png)

The frame is assembled through a combination of blind joints and corner brackets. The corner brackets are to help stiffen up the frame and are optional, though we highly recommend using them on every possible corner for best results.

For detailed informations on how to assemble blind joints visit this [page](../general/blind-joints)

### Step 1
![Step 1](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step1.png)

| | |
|-|-|
| ![Screw](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step1_screw_extrusion.png) | We take the **E screw** and fasten it in the outer hole of the **A extrusion**, there should be a gap between the **E screw** and the extrusion big enough to slide the **B extrusion** on.
| | |
| | |
| | |
| ![Mount](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step1_mount.png) | We now take the **B extrusion** and slide it on the **A extrusion** and tighten down the **E screw** just enough so that the **B extrusion** can't slide off. We will tighten up this screws later when we made sure the frame is square.|

### Step 2
![Step 2](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step2.png)

| | |
|-|-|
| ![Screw](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step2_screw_extrusion.png) | We take the **E screw** and fasten it in the outer hole of the **A extrusion**, there should be a gap between the **E screw** and the extrusion big enough to slide the **B extrusion** on.
| | |
| | |
| | |
| ![Mount](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step2_mount.png) | We now take the assembled part from **Step 1** and slide it on the **A extrusion** and tighten down the **E screw** just enough so that the **B extrusion** can't slide off. We will tighten up this screws later when we made sure the frame is square.

### Step 3
Repeat the steps from **Step 1** and **Step 2** for the other u-shaped side.

### Step 4

![Step 4](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step4.png)

| | |
|-|-|
| ![Screw](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step4_screw_extrusion.png) | We take the **E screw** and fasten it in the second hole of the **A extrusion**, there should be a gap between the **E screw** and the extrusion big enough to slide the **C extrusion** on.
| | |
| | |
| | |
| ![Mount](../assets/images/manual/vz330_mellow/frame/step4_mount.png) | We now take the assembled u-shape part and slide the **C extrusion** on it and tighten down the **E screw** just enough so that the **C extrusion** can't slide off. We will tighten up this screws later when we made sure the frame is square.
