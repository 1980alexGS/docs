# VzBoT Vz235

![Overview](../assets/images/manual/vz235_printed/printed_preview.png)
<br>
<br>

Vz235 is the smaller brother of the original [Vz330](/vz330) 3D-printer. With its
relatively small build volume, it has reduced weight and a smaller form factor. The design
is built around the popular Creality Ender 3 bed, but is not limited to this size: the
frame can be scaled up or down to fit the individual builder's requirements.

On how to print the files for this printer please refer to [print settings](../general/print-settings)
