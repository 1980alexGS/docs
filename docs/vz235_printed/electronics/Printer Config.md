# 6.4 Setting up the Printer.cfg

Now comes the fun part of the setup. Configuring your printer.cfg.

We're gonna start with this basic start config file for you guys to use.
![printer.cfg](../../assets/images/manual/vz235_printed/electronics/Printer_config/printer.cfg)

In order to use the Exlcude object command in your Mainsail or Fluid we're also gonna need this file: [Exclude_Object.cfg](../../assets/images/manual/vz235_printed/electronics/Printer_config/Exclude_Object.cfg)

Put both of those files in your Machine tab of Mainsail like this:
